1: Line 9 prints 20. 

2: Line 13 prints 20.

3: The code returns an error. This is because the variable "result" is declared with the let keyword, meaning that this variable is provided with block scope (it is only accessed in the same block it was declared). Because "result" was only declared in the if block, and line 13 is outside of that if block, attempting to access the variable at line 13 will return an error.

4: The code returns an error (its the same code as from question 3).

5: The code returns an error. This is because the variable "result" is declared with the const keyword and is initialized to 0 in line 5. This means that "result" has a constant reference to the value 0. This reference cannot be changed. However, the code tries to modify the reference of "result" by changing its reference to the value num1 + num2 = 20. This attempt to change its constant reference generates an error.

6: The code returns an error (its the same code as from question 5).
