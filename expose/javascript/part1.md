1: Line 9 prints "values added: 20". 

2: Line 13 prints "final result: 20".

3: Line 9 prints "values added: 20".

4: The code returns an error. This is because the variable "result" is declared with the let keyword, meaning that this variable is provided with block scope (it is only accessed in the same block it was declared). Because "result" was only declared in the if block, and line 13 is outside of that if block, attempting to access the variable at line 13 will return an error.

5: The code returns an error. This is because the variable "result" is declared with the const keyword and is initialized to 0 in line 5. This means that "result" has a constant reference to the value 0. This reference cannot be changed. However, the code tries to modify the reference of "result" by changing its reference to the value num1 + num2 = 20. This attempt to change its constant reference generates an error.

6: The code returns an error for the same reason as provided in question 5. Additionally, the variable "result" was declared with const inside the if block, so it cannot be accessed outside that block, which is what line 13 tries to do.
