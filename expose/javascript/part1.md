1: Line 9 prints 20. 

2: Line 13 prints 20.

3: The code returns an error. This is because the variable "result" is declared with the let keyword, meaning that this variable is provided with block scope (it is only accessed in the same block it was declared). Because "result" was only declared in the if block, and line 13 is outside of that if block, attempting to access the variable at line 13 will return an error.

4: The code returns an error (its the same code as from question 3).

5: Line 9 generates an error. This is because the variable "result" is declared with the const keyword and is initialized to 0 in line 5. The value of variables declared with the const keyword cannot be changed after being initialized (remains contant). So, the value of "result" must stay as 0, but in the code we are trying to change its value from 0 to num1 + num2 = 20. This attempt to change its value generates an error.

6: The code returns an error (its the same code as from question 5).
